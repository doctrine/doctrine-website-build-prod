<h1>Contribute</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Doctrine Project Contributors Guide. This documentation
aims to document how contributors and maintainers should work when using
git, development workflow, build process, dependency management, etc.</p>
<div class="section" id="about">
<h2>About</h2>
<p>The Doctrine Project is the home of a selected set of PHP libraries
primarily focused on providing persistence services and related
functionality. Its prize projects are the Object Relational Mapper and
the Database Abstraction Layer it is built on top of. You can view a
list of all <a href="projects.html">projects</a> on the website.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="contributors-vs-maintainers">
<h2>Contributors vs Maintainers</h2>
<p>Before continuing you need to understand the difference between a
contributor and a maintainer.</p>
<ul>
    <li class="dash">Contributor: A contributor is someone from the outside not on the
core development team of the project that wants to contribute some
changes to a project.</li>
<li class="dash">Maintainer: A maintainer is someone on the core development team of
the project and has commit access to the main repository of the
project.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="contributor-workflow">
<h2>Contributor Workflow</h2>
<p>Who is a contributor? A contributor can be anyone! It could be you.
Continue reading this section if you wish to get involved and start
contributing back to a Doctrine project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="initial-setup">
<h2>Initial Setup</h2>
<p>We are assuming you have cloned the project, have a Github account, and
have forked the project. If any of this sounds unfamiliar, please <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects">learn about that</a>
first.</p>
<p>When cloning, you will end up with a remote called <code>origin</code>. This can
be confusing because sometimes, people use <code>origin</code> to refer to their
fork, some other times they use it to refer to the original project.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion, we recommend you remove <code>origin</code> altogether:</p>
<div class="console"><pre><code class="console"><span class="noselect">$ </span>git remote remove origin</code></pre></div>
<p>To make the example commands given in the rest of this page less
ambiguous, we will add two explicit names for remote Git repositories:
<code>doctrine</code> for the original Doctrine project you're contributing to, and
<code>fork</code> for your fork of it.</p>
<div class="console"><pre><code class="console"><span class="noselect">$ </span>[`cd` into the directory created by `git clone ...`]
<span class="noselect">$ </span>git remote add doctrine git@github.com:doctrine/<name-of-project>.git
<span class="noselect">$ </span>git remote add fork git@github.com:<your-github-name>/<name-of-project>.git</code></pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="choosing-the-right-branch">
<h2>Choosing the right branch</h2>
<p>Before you start working on a feature or a bug fix, you need to choose
which branch you are going to contribute to. We try hard to follow
semver, which means there are three choices.</p>
<p>Let's say the latest version of the project is 2.3.1. The following
branches should exist and are the possible choices:</p>
<ul>
    <li class="dash"><code>2.3.x</code> from which the next patch release will be tagged (2.3.2, 2.3.3, etc.);</li>
<li class="dash"><code>2.4.x</code> from which the next minor release will be tagged (2.4.0);</li>
<li class="dash"><code>3.0.x</code> from which the next major release will be tagged (3.0.0).</li>
</ul>
<p>To find out what's the latest version, you can check the Releases
block on the project's Github page. Alternatively, you can check
Packagist.</p>
<p>Anything you contribute to a branch will be merged up to higher branches
at some point. For example, if you contribute to <code>2.3.x</code>, your changes
will eventually land on <code>2.4.x</code> and <code>3.0.x</code>.</p>
<p>The general rules are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li class="dash">Patch releases should be as stable as possible. They fix bugs, but
avoid making changes as much as possible.</li>
<li class="dash">Improvements and additions are being made on the upcoming minor
release branch.</li>
<li class="dash">An upgrade to a new minor version must not require any changes on the
user's side.</li>
<li class="dash">There must be a clear upgrade path from one major version to the next.
That means necessary changes on the user's side will be advertised
through deprecation notices, if anyway possible.</li>
<li class="dash">Deprecations may be added for new minor versions only.</li>
<li class="dash">Before a feature is removed (or an API changed) in a major version
release, a corresponding deprecation notice must be included in a
minor version release preceding it.</li>
<li class="dash">If a replacement feature and/or alternative API will be provided, it
must be available in the minor release that adds the deprecation for
the old feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that in mind, things that can go on the patch release branch
include:</p>
<ul>
    <li class="dash">bugfixes;</li>
<li class="dash">adding tests, especially for bugs that were fixed;</li>
<li class="dash">updates, corrections or improvements to non-code assets like
documentation, build scripts or tooling configuration;</li>
<li class="dash">fixes to incorrect phpdoc comments (docblock type declarations, etc.);</li>
<li class="dash">updates, corrections or improvements to code comments that are not
phpdoc comments;</li>

<p>Have you made your choice? Good. You now need to create a topic branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-topic-branch">
<h2>Creating a topic branch</h2>
<p>You should avoid making changes directly on the patch, minor or major
release branches, also in your fork of the repository. That makes it
difficult for you to have more than one pull request at a time, and also
complicates matters should you need to rebase your work to another base
branch some time later on. Instead, for every change that you would like
to propose, create a dedicated topic branch.</p>
<div class="alert note-admonition bg-light-yellow text-dark border"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="10" class="align-top"><i class="fas fa-sticky-note text-primary mr-2"></i></td><td><p>If that does not sound all too familiar, you might want to read
about <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow.">GitHub Flow</a>
for additional background information</p>
</td></tr></table></div>
<p>Time might have elapsed since the last time you contributed or since you
cloned the repository. You might want to fetch the latest changes from
the <code>doctrine</code> remote:</p>
<div class="console"><pre><code class="console"><span class="noselect">$ </span>git fetch doctrine</code></pre></div>
<div class="alert note-admonition bg-light-yellow text-dark border"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="10" class="align-top"><i class="fas fa-sticky-note text-primary mr-2"></i></td><td><p>Remember, we assume that <code>doctrine</code> points to the original
Doctrine project repository and not to your fork, as described in
the initial section of this page. If unsure, you can check with
<code>git remote -v</code>.</p>
</td></tr></table></div>
<p>I know it sounds awful, but the next step is to deal with one of the 2
hard problems in computer science and come up with a name for your
branch. Pick something meaningful.</p>
<p>If you have a feature to contribute that adds support for a new database
called YourSQL, you could create a branch called <code>your-sql-support</code>
from the next minor branch:</p>
<div class="console"><pre><code class="console"><span class="noselect">$ </span>git switch --create your-sql-support doctrine/2.4.x # use -c for short</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, using <code>doctrine/2.4.x</code> instead of just <code>2.4.x</code> means you do
not have to switch to 2.4.x and update it first.</p>
<p>Now do your changes, and when you are done, you need to commit them.
To pick the right changes, we recommend you use <code>git add --patch</code>. It
will force you to review what you are about to commit.</p>
<div class="console"><pre><code class="console"><span class="noselect">$ </span>git add --patch      # use -p for short</code></pre></div>
<p>Likewise, when you commit, we recommend you use <code>--verbose</code>. It will
show the diff again in your editor.</p>
<div class="console"><pre><code class="console"><span class="noselect">$ </span>git commit --verbose # use -v for short</code></pre></div>
<p>It is important that you pause here and make the effort of writing a
meaningful commit message.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="crafting-meaningful-commit-messages">
<h2>Crafting meaningful commit messages</h2>
<p>Commit messages should look like emails, meaning they should have a
subject, but also a body. The subject should be on the first line, and
not exceed 50 chars. It should tell us what you did, and every change in
the diff should have to do with that subject. The body should be
separated from it by a blank line and should tell us <em>why</em> you did what
you did. That is also a good place to tell people about alternate
solutions that were considered and the reasons for rejecting them. Links
to related issues are more than welcome, but should be summarized so
that the pull request can be understood without resorting to them.
Ideally, the git history should be understandable without a network
connection. Here is an example of a good although fictitious commit
message:</p>
<pre><code class="">Call foo::bar() instead of bar::baz()

This fixes a bug that arises when doing this or that, because baz()
needs a flux capacitor object that might not be defined.
I considered calling foobar(), but decided against because
$nonObviousYetVeryGoodReason
Fixes #42
</code></pre>
<p>Wrap the lines in the commit body at 72 chars to make commits easier
to read in different tools.</p>
<p>There are already a few articles (or even single purpose websites) about
this in case you want to read more about this:</p>
<ul>
    <li class="dash"><a href="https://www.strangeleaflet.com/blog/deliberate-git">Deliberate git</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Once you are done, you can push your branch to your fork:</p>
<div class="console"><pre><code class="console"><span class="noselect">$ </span>git push --set-upstream fork your-sql-support # use -u for short</code></pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-the-pull-request">
<h2>Creating the pull request</h2>
<p>New pull requests are created with the repository's default branch as
base branch, and that might not be what you want.</p>
<p>The base branch should be what you chose according to the guidelines
mentioned in the beginning of this chapter. It is also the branch name
that you provided when you created your topic branch.</p>
<p>Make sure to pick the correct branch when creating the pull request. If
you do not, it can still be changed afterwards (see the dedicated
section below).</p>
<p>The default branch is the branch you see when you enter the repository
page on GitHub.</p>
<img src="../images/default-branch.png" alt="The default branch" style="margin-bottom: 20px" />
<p>In this DBAL example, it's the branch with the name <strong>2.11.x</strong>. The
branch name reflects the current lowest supported version of a
repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="to-squash-or-not-to-squash">
<h2>To squash or not to squash</h2>
<p>The best way to avoid having to squash anything in the first place is to
amend your last commit if that's indeed where your extra change is meant
to go. That being said, sometimes you end up with many commits and it's
too late for that. Some other times, code review has already started and
it can be better not to touch already reviewed commits. You can signal
that they should ultimately be squashed by using <code>git commit
--fixup=HEAD</code>, which will also spare you the creation of a commit
message since it will reuse the previous one.</p>
<p>Now let's say that code review is finished, or that it hasn't started,
and that you want to squash some commits.</p>
<p>If you are in the fairly simple case where you want squash all your
commits into one, you can take <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#_squashing">the following steps described in the manual</a>
to achieve that.</p>
<p>If you are in a more complex case where you would very much like to keep
your commits separate, there are other solutions.
To take a specific example, let us say that you made 3 commits A, B, C,
and you have CS issues in A and in C.
To make sure that is no longer the case, fixing each of these commits
can be done like this:
<code>git rebase --exec &quot;vendor/bin/phpcbf &amp;&amp; vendor/bin/phpcs&quot; A^</code>
That command will run phpcbf and then phpcs for each of your commits and
will halt for A and C, but not for B because in the case of B they would
exit with a zero status code. That will let you amend A, after which you
can resume the rebase until you do the same for C. Here is how it would
look like on A:</p>
<div class="console"><pre><code class="console"><span class="noselect">$ </span>vendor/bin/phpcs      # check for issues phpcbf could not fix
<span class="noselect">$ </span>git add -p            # commit whatever issues were fixed
<span class="noselect">$ </span>git commit --amend    # change A
<span class="noselect">$ </span>git rebase --continue # resume the rebase</code></pre></div>
<p>You should be able to apply the example above with any tool we use in
our CI pipelines, such as PHPUnit, PHPStan or Psalm.</p>
<p><code>git rebase --interactive</code> is a really powerful tool and we barely
scratched the tip of the iceberg here. If you want to learn more about
it, we recommend you watch <a href="https://youtu.be/uI1V7771plw?t=814">this talk from Pauline Vos</a></p>
<p>Of course, if you want to craft good commits with good messages, you
will have a hard time if the changeset you are describing does too many
things. That might very well happen if you notice small things along the
way that are unrelated to your PR, but too small to warrant a separate
one. <code>git add --patch</code> or <code>git add -p</code> will be of invaluable help to
commit things separately.
On the contrary, there are commits that typically do not need to exist,
such as commits that fix coding style or address minor review comments.
Bear in mind that the git log is not only aimed at reviewers, but also
at anyone who wants to understand some change you made. Do not distract
them with cs fixes. Instead, try to produce a commit that contains your
changes <em>and</em> the necessary fixes to pass coding standard checks.
Also, it's best if all of your commits pass the build, because that
makes them <code>git bisect</code> friendly, but it also means they are likely to
be revertable independently from other commits in your PR. While being
revertable is not particularly crucial to us, it can help you decide
whether to squash or whether to split. For instance, it would not make
sense to revert a commit documenting a feature without also reverting
the code for that feature. That means there should be only once commit
with both the code and the docs here.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rebasing">
<h2>Rebasing</h2>
<div class="section" id="on-upstream-changes">
<h3>On upstream changes</h3>
<p>Sometimes, you will need to rebase your branch on the latest changes,
typically because the build had an issue unrelated to your changes, and
that issue has been fixed after you created your branch.</p>
<p>Basically, a rebase takes all changes on your topic branch and moves
them to another starting point. This starting point was the Doctrine
branch that you chose when you created your topic branch, at that point
in time. The rebase will move your changes to be based on the current
state of this branch.</p>
<p>Here is how to proceed if you need to rebase on <code>2.3.x</code>:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
    <li>Switch to the branch you would like to rebase.</li>
<li>Fetch all new commits: <code>git fetch doctrine</code>.</li>
<li>Rebase on what you fetched:
<code>git rebase doctrine/2.3.x</code></li>
<li>If you run into a conflict, fix it and add the resolved conflicts
(you can do that with <code>git mergetool</code> for instance), then
continue on your merry way with <code>git rebase --continue</code>.</li>
<li>Force push to overwrite the previous version : <code>git push --force</code>.</li>
</ol>
<a id="rebasing-on-another-branch"></a>
</div>
<div class="section" id="on-another-branch">
<h3>On another branch</h3>
<p>Another case where you need a rebase is when you want to change the
target branch of your PR. For instance, you might have created your PR
against <code>2.3.x</code> but you are told to change it to <code>2.4.x</code>. In that
case, the following command will pick all changes that you made against
the <code>2.3.x</code> branch, and re-apply them on the current <code>2.4.x</code> branch.</p>
<div class="console"><pre><code class="console"><span class="noselect">$ </span>git fetch doctrine
<span class="noselect">$ </span>git rebase --onto doctrine/2.4.x doctrine/2.3.x your-topic-branch
<span class="noselect">$ </span>git push --force</code></pre></div>
<p>After that, you also need to update the GitHub pull request to point to
the new target branch. You can do so by clicking on the Edit button
next to the pull request title. After you changed the target branch, the
pull request should only show your commits and changes, but this time
they are based on the new target branch.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project-dependencies">
<h2>Project Dependencies</h2>
<p>Project dependencies between Doctrine projects are handled through
composer. The code of the particular Doctrine project you have cloned is
located under <strong>lib/Doctrine</strong>. The source code of dependencies to other
projects resides under <strong>vendor/</strong>.</p>
<p>To bump/upgrade a dependency version you just need to update the version
constraint in composer.json and run:</p>
<div class="console"><pre><code class="console"><span class="noselect">$ </span>composer update</code></pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dealing-with-checks-and-tools">
<h2>Dealing with checks and tools</h2>
<p>We get lots of PRs, and each of them goes though a series of checks that
should catch obvious mistakes, so that we can focus on higher order
issues. The checks are fairly standardized across all our projects, so
here is a list of the most common ones and how to deal with them.
Before you can run any of these locally, you will need to install
dependencies with <code>composer install</code>.</p>
<div class="section" id="coding-standard-check">
<h3>Coding standard check</h3>
<p>We use <a href="https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer">PHP_CodeSniffer</a>
along with the <a href="https://github.com/doctrine/coding-standard">Doctrine Coding Standard</a>.</p>
<p>To get a list of coding standard issues, run:</p>
<div class="console"><pre><code class="console"><span class="noselect">$ </span>vendor/bin/phpcs</code></pre></div>
<p>To automatically fix some of the issues, run:</p>
<div class="console"><pre><code class="console"><span class="noselect">$ </span>vendor/bin/phpcbf</code></pre></div>
<p>Some issues are impossible to fix automatically, so you will have to fix
them manually.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="static-analysis">
<h3>Static analysis</h3>
<p>We use two different static analysis tools, that can be complementary:</p>
<ul>
    <li class="dash"><a href="https://psalm.dev/">Psalm</a></li>
<li class="dash"><a href="https://phpstan.org/">PHPStan</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is how to run both tools:</p>
<div class="console"><pre><code class="console"><span class="noselect">$ </span>vendor/bin/psalm
<span class="noselect">$ </span>vendor/bin/phpstan</code></pre></div>
<p>It might happen that these tools report false positives. In that case,
we try to report the false positives upstream, and then we ignore them
in <code>psalm.xml</code> or <code>phpstan.neon</code>, along with a link to the bug
report.</p>
<p>When things get overwhelming, for instance when upgrading Psalm or
PHPStan, we use baseline files, but as a last resort: it's better to
have new code pass analysis with the latest version of the tools than to
block the ugprade until every single issue is addressed.</p>
<p>If you are looking for something to contribute, you can try to
reduce the baseline files in repositories that have them.
This might happen accidentally when working on code, and both tools are
configured to let you know when you should remove lines from the
baseline.</p>
<p>We never rely on <code>@psalm-suppress</code> except in some Symfony bundles. We
are aware of this inconsistency, and might resolve it someday. Until
then, try to be consistent with the repository you are contributing to.</p>
<p>Both tools understand most of each other annotations, and we use
<code>@psalm-</code>-prefixed annotations and let PHPStan do the translation. We
use prefixed annotations for advanced features that are not understood
by all IDEs yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tests">
<h3>Tests</h3>
<p>We use <a href="https://phpunit.de/">PHPUnit</a> for our tests. You can run them
with <code>vendor/bin/phpunit</code>. We often have more than just one PHPUnit
check, because we want to run them with different versions of PHP, or
with different versions of infrastructure components (e.g. different
RDBMS), etc. All these jobs produce coverage reports, which are gathered
and sent to Codecov. If you see a coverage drop, it is likely that you
are missing a test for some code you added.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="running-checks-before-pushing">
<h3>Running checks before pushing</h3>
<p>Rather than starting many containers on a remote infrastructure to
figure what is wrong with your code, running some of the checks locally
before pushing is never a bad idea. You can do so by creating a
<code>.git/hooks/pre-push</code> file or even a <code>.git/hooks/pre-commit</code> file
with the following content:</p>
<div class="console"><pre><code class="console">#!/bin/bash
set -e
echo ''|vendor/bin/phpcs
vendor/bin/phpstan
vendor/bin/psalm
vendor/bin/phpunit</code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-your-pr-reviewed">
<h2>Getting your PR reviewed</h2>
<p>Doctrine is a huge project, and we get lots of PRs. It is natural for
maintainers to focus on PRs that have green checks. If you want to get a
review on your PR despite red checks, be explicit about that, otherwise
we might assume that you are still working on it. We try never to merge
PRs with red checks, even if the failure is unrelated to the PR. This
avoids situations where some failures are unrelated to the PR, but some
are not, and we end up merging a PR that breaks the build even more.</p>
<p>If you know you are not done but still want to get a review, you can
mark your PR as Draft, and then ask for the review. This way, we know
you acknowledge that the PR is not ready to be merged, and just want
guidance or a basic approval before you put more effort into it. We are
not mind readers though, so the best way to get exactly what you want is
to explicitly ask for it.</p>
<p>Note that because of the integration between Github and automated tools,
PRs with a lot of coding standard or static analysis issues might be
quite hard to review, with all the noise added by automated comments in
the diff. Despite what is said previously, you might want to fix as many
issues as easily doable before asking for a review.</p>
