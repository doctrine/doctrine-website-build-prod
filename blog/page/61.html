        <hr />

        <div>
            <p>In this post I want to clarify some things about transactions and
performance of PHP applications in general. I want to show you that
it is very easy to lose a lot of performance without using any
&quot;heavy&quot; framework at all and I also want to show that frameworks
can actually help you avoid a lot of these problems transparently.
I want to sensibilize you for the fact that there are a lot of
factors in PHP application performance and that you can very easily
lose the performance that you hoped to gain by not using framework
X or Z or building your own (&quot;Not Invented Here&quot;-syndrome) by
several orders of magnitude through rather trivial errors or
misconceptions.</p>
<p>Given a MySql database with InnoDB tables, which of the following
code snippets that insert 20 users do you think is faster? First
the Doctrine (2) version:</p>
<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php
// Using Doctrine 2 to insert 20 users
for ($i=0; $i&lt;20; ++$i) {
    $user = new CmsUser;
    $user-&gt;name = 'Guilherme';
    $user-&gt;status = 'Slave';
    $user-&gt;username = 'gblanco';
    $em-&gt;persist($user);
}

$s = microtime(true);
$em-&gt;flush();
$e = microtime(true);
echo ($e - $s) . &quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>Now the good old mysql\_query version:</p>
<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php
$s = microtime(true);
for ($i=0; $i&lt;20; ++$i) {
    mysql_query(&quot;INSERT INTO cms_users (name, status, username) VALUES ('Guilherme', 'Slave', 'gblanco')&quot;, $link);
}
$e = microtime(true);
echo ($e - $s) . &quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>Even this comparison is not fair since flush() is doing a lot more
stuff but anyhow. The results might surprise some of you:</p>

<pre><code class="">Doctrine 2: 0.0094 seconds
mysql_query: 0.0165 seconds
</code></pre>
<p>Yes, our good old mysql\_query code is almost twice as slow even
though it does a lot less, provides no features, no abstraction, no
basic protection against SQL injection, etc. Why is that? The
answer is: transactions. In the Doctrine 2 example, Doctrine takes
over transaction management for us and efficiently executes all
inserts in a single, short transaction. In the plain mysql\_query
example, there is no transaction demarcation and since MySql by
default operates in autocommit mode, every mysql\_query call will
implicitly commit the transaction and start a new one. Thats 20
transactions. Here is the revised code of the second example with
proper transaction demarcation:</p>
<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php
$s = microtime(true);
mysql_query('START TRANSACTION', $link);
for ($i=0; $i&lt;20; ++$i) {
    mysql_query(&quot;INSERT INTO cms_users (name, status, username) VALUES ('Guilherme', 'Slave', 'gblanco')&quot;, $link);
}
mysql_query('COMMIT', $link);
$e = microtime(true);
echo ($e - $s) . &quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>The result:</p>

<pre><code class="">mysql_query: 0.0028 seconds
</code></pre>
<p>Thats a huge difference. We can conclude:</p>
<p><strong>Bad or no transaction management/demarcation can reduce performance by several orders of magnitude.</strong></p>
<p>Many people are used to autocommit mode without really being aware
of what it is doing. It does not mean there is no transaction
unless you issue START/BEGIN TRANSACTION or PDO#beginTransaction().
It means after every single query a transaction is committed
automatically and a new one started. Methods like
PDO#beginTransaction() merely suspend autocommit mode for a short
duration (until you call PDO#commit()/PDO#rollback()).</p>
<p>To clarify:</p>
<p><strong>You can not talk to your database outside of a transaction.</strong></p>
<p>Even SELECT queries get wrapped in a small transaction in
autocommit mode. However since SELECT statements usually don't
result in any write locks (like INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) the penalty
of these transactions is usually not that big.</p>
<p>Doctrine 2 can help a lot here. You can modify your objects
anywhere, persist and delete objects anywhere and once you call
<code>EntityManager#flush()</code> Doctrine 2 will efficiently make all
updates in a single transaction.</p>
<p>What I wanted to highlight with this post is that there are a lot
of factors that influence the performance of your application, and
raw execution speed of the code is certainly not one of the most
influential ones. You can very easily lose 10 times the performance
by trivial things such as the one shown above (bad/no transaction
demarcation) than what you gained by choosing some &quot;ultra
lightweight&quot; PHP framework or a homegrown solution.</p>
<p>There are many more factors, like network load, inefficient
database indices or no indices, and much more. Don't just always
look at the raw execution speed of your code. Use code that is well
tested, established, used by lots of people and developed by lots
of people. Don't reinvent the wheel and use existing tools or help
make existing tools better! (Oh, and use the right tool for the
job, of course!)</p>
<p>Most of the time when you think your own solutions are much better
and have a lot less bugs than existing ones then thats most likely
just because noone else is using it and so the bugs are never found
:-).</p>
<p>PS: If you're still confused by the autocommit mode, let me
recommend this excellent page from the Hibernate project:
<a href="https://www.hibernate.org/403.html">Non-transactional data access and the auto-commit mode</a></p>

        <hr />

        <div>
            <p>If you are familar with Doctrine\_RawSql from Doctrine 1.x you
probably know that it is somewhat broken by design since it
requires a special syntax in the select clause that makes a lot of
SQL constructs in the select clause impossible.</p>
<p>Doctrine 2 introduces a facility called &quot;native queries&quot;,
represented by the <code>Doctrine\ORM\NativeQuery</code> class that replaces
Doctrine\_RawSql. The clue about NativeQuery is that it allows the
usage of real native SQL yet the result can be transformed into all
the different formats that are supported by DQL.</p>
<p>This is achieved through having a generic description of how an SQL
result maps to a Doctrine result in form of a
<code>Doctrine\ORM\Query\ResultSetMapping</code>.</p>
<p>Enough of the introductory talk, lets look at a (primitive) example
from our test suite:</p>
<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php
$rsm = new ResultSetMapping;
$rsm-&gt;addEntityResult('Doctrine\Tests\Models\CMS\CmsUser', 'u');
$rsm-&gt;addFieldResult('u', 'id', 'id'); // ($alias, $columnName, $fieldName)
$rsm-&gt;addFieldResult('u', 'name', 'name'); // // ($alias, $columnName, $fieldName)

$query = $this-&gt;_em-&gt;createNativeQuery('SELECT id, name FROM cms_users WHERE username = ?', $rsm);
$query-&gt;setParameter(1, 'romanb');

$users = $query-&gt;getResult();

$this-&gt;assertEquals(1, count($users));
$this-&gt;assertTrue($users[0] instanceof CmsUser);
$this-&gt;assertEquals('Roman', $users[0]-&gt;getName());
</code></pre>
<p>The SQL that is passed to createNativeQuery is not touched by
Doctrine in any way. The NativeQuery and ResultSetMapping
combination are extremely powerful. It might not surprise you that
Doctrine 2 creates a ResultSetMapping internally when it transforms
DQL to SQL.</p>
<p>Granted, this was a very trivial example that can easily be
expressed in a short DQL 1-liner but it was just for demonstration
purposes (and I am bad at making up complex ad-hoc SQL examples
that make sense).</p>
<p>So when is this useful? While DQL has been heavily improved in
Doctrine 2 and has many new powerful features which we will cover
in future blog posts, it is sometimes necessary to use native SQL.
NativeQuery gives you the ability to do that while still retrieving
the results in the convenient Doctrine formats you are familar
with. NativeQuery is also an obvious choice when starting to
migrate a pure SQL project to Doctrine without going into all the
DQL details from the start.</p>
<p>More on NativeQuery and ResultSetMapping can be found in the new
documentation under:</p>

            <p><strong>TIP</strong> Disclaimer: In general, an ORM is surely not the best tool
    for the job for mass data movements, however, it can be a
    convenient alternative if the performance is sufficient. Every
    RDBMS has its own highly efficient commands for such operations.
    For maximum efficiency you should consult the manual of your

<p>A lot of people have encountered the infamous &quot;memory exhausted&quot;
errors when using Doctrine for bulk operations or in long-running
scripts. This is a problem that is the result of 2 things:</p>
<ul><li class="dash"> The often unnecessarily intertwined architecture of Doctrine
   1.x.</li>
<li class="dash"> The simple garbage collector of PHP &lt; 5.3.
    <strong>NOTE</strong> If you did not know it yet, basically every circular
    reference between objects (and that is every bidirectional
    relationship!) is a potential memory leak in PHP &lt; 5.3.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, the PHP team did their homework and introduced a new garbage
collector in PHP 5.3 (that is enabled by default, thank god!) that
is capable of properly detecting cyclic references that are not
referenced any longer from the outside.</p>
<p>In Doctrine 2 we did our part of the homework to address this issue
and redesigned the Doctrine core from scratch. The result is a much
better user experience, as I will demonstrate with some examples.</p>
<a id="title.1"></a><h1>Mass inserts</h1>
<p>The first thing we will look at is mass inserts. In Doctrine 2
there is a special pattern that can be used for mass inserts that
looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php
// $em instanceof EntityManager
$batchSize = 20;
for ($i=1; $i&lt;=10000; ++$i) {
     $obj = new MyEntity;
     $obj-&gt;setFoo('...');
     // ... set more data
     $em-&gt;persist($obj);
     if (($i % $batchSize) == 0) {
         $em-&gt;flush();
         $em-&gt;clear();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>I used this pattern to create a little demonstration that looks
like this in a PHPUnit test:</p>
<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php
// $this-&gt;_em created in setUp()
echo &quot;Memory usage before: &quot; . (memory_get_usage() / 1024) . &quot; KB&quot; . PHP_EOL;
$s = microtime(true);
$batchSize = 20;
for ($i=1; $i&lt;=10000; ++$i) {
     $user = new CmsUser;
     $user-&gt;status = 'user';
     $user-&gt;username = 'user' . $i;
     $user-&gt;name = 'Mr.Smith-' . $i;
     $this-&gt;_em-&gt;persist($user);
     if (($i % $batchSize) == 0) {
         $this-&gt;_em-&gt;flush();
         $this-&gt;_em-&gt;clear();
    }
}

//gc_collect_cycles(); // explained later!
echo &quot;Memory usage after: &quot; . (memory_get_usage() / 1024) . &quot; KB&quot; . PHP_EOL;

$e = microtime(true);
echo ' Inserted 10000 objects in ' . ($e - $s) . ' seconds' . PHP_EOL;
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we insert a total of 10000 objects. On running this
code through PHPUnit, using an SQLite in-memory database, I got the
following output:</p>

<pre><code class="">Memory usage before: 5034.03515625 KB
Memory usage after: 6726.3515625 KB
Inserted 10000 objects in 3.165983915329 seconds
</code></pre>
<p>We can see the following:</p>
<ul><li class="dash"> The insertion of 10000 objects through Doctrine into an SQLite
   in-memory database took roughly 3 seconds, not too bad.</li>
<li class="dash"> Memory usage increased by roughly 1.7MB, not too bad either.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are now still not satisfied and wonder where the 1.7MB are
going, here is the answer: A small part of that is occupied by
objects that were created on-demand internally by Doctrine, these
will stay pretty constant, however. But the majority of this 1.7MB
has simply not yet been reclaimed (but is eliglible for garbage
collection for the new garbage collector!). To prove that, I can
just uncomment the gc\_collect\_cycles() function call. Here's the
result:</p>

<pre><code class="">Memory usage before: 5034.3828125 KB
Memory usage after: 5502.21484375 KB
Inserted 10000 objects in 3.1807188987732 seconds
</code></pre>
<p>Much better! And to prove that the &nbsp;500KB occupied by Doctrine are
constant, I simply made it 20000 objects. Here is the result:</p>

<pre><code class="">Memory usage before: 5034.3828125 KB
Memory usage after: 5502.21484375 KB
Inserted 20000 objects in 6.6149919033051 seconds
</code></pre>
<p>We can see the following things:</p>
<ul><li class="dash"> Memory usage is constant, the second batch of 10000 objects did
   not result in additional memory usage.</li>
<li class="dash"> The mass insertion strategy scales almost linearly. 10k objects
   took &nbsp;3.2 seconds and 20k objects took &nbsp;6.6 seconds.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: You do not really need to call gc\_collect\_cycles(). This
should just demonstrate that the memory can be reclaimed. PHP would
reclaim that memory anyway when it needs to.</p>
<p>Even better, when testing the peak memory usage
(memory\_get\_peak\_usage()) it turned out that the memory usage
never grew beyond &nbsp;10MB in between. If you choose a larger batch
size the peak memory usage will be higher and vice versa.</p>
<a id="title.2"></a><h1>Mass object processing</h1>
<p>Now we take a look at mass-processing objects, which means loading
10000 objects from the database and doing something with each of
them. The clue here is the new support for iterative (step-by-step)
hydration in Doctrine 2. The pattern for these kinds of tasks looks
as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php
$q = $this-&gt;_em-&gt;createQuery(&quot;&lt;DQL to select the objects I want&gt;&quot;);
$iterableResult = $q-&gt;iterate();
while (($row = $iterableResult-&gt;next()) !== false) {
        // do stuff with the data in the row, $row[0] is always the object
        $this-&gt;_em-&gt;detach($row[0]); // detach from Doctrine, so that it can be GC'd immediately
 }
</code></pre>
<p>So instead of using <code>$q-&gt;execute()</code> or <code>$q-&gt;getResult()</code> or
similar, we use <code>$q-&gt;iterate()</code> which returns an instance of
<code>IterableResult</code> that allows us to iterate over the result step
by step. The important part for not running out of memory is the
line where the created object is detached from Doctrine, which
results in Doctrine removing any internal references to that
object, Doctrine no longer &quot;knows&quot; about that object.</p>
<p>I used this pattern to iterate through the just inserted 10000
objects as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php
$q = $this-&gt;_em-&gt;createQuery(&quot;select u from Doctrine\Tests\Models\CMS\CmsUser u&quot;);
$iterableResult = $q-&gt;iterate();

echo &quot;Memory usage before: &quot; . (memory_get_usage() / 1024) . &quot; KB&quot; . PHP_EOL;

while (($row = $iterableResult-&gt;next()) !== false) {
    // ... I could do some stuff here
    $this-&gt;_em-&gt;detach($row[0]);
}

echo &quot;Memory usage after: &quot; . (memory_get_usage() / 1024) . &quot; KB&quot; . PHP_EOL;
</code></pre>
<p>The following is the result:</p>

<pre><code class="">Memory usage before: 6578.58984375 KB
Memory usage after: 6581.71875 KB
</code></pre>
<p>The result is pretty acceptable. Here is the same again, this time
for 20000 objects, again to prove that the small memory increase is
constant:</p>

<pre><code class="">Memory usage before: 6578.23828125 KB 
Memory usage after: 6581.359375 KB
</code></pre>
<p>Good stuff!</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>NOTE</strong> If you're thinking that I waited ages until the 10k or 20k
objects were hydrated, that was not the case. 10k or 20k objects
(without associations) are hydrated in seconds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More information on bulk operations with Doctrine 2 can be found in
the (very new) online manual that is still a work in progress:</p>
<p>http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/2\_0/en/batch-processing</p>
<a id="title.3"></a><h1>UPDATE</h1>
<p>Some people seem to be wondering why Doctrine does not use
multi-inserts (insert into (...) values (...), (...), (...), ...</p>
<p>First of all, this syntax is only supported on mysql and newer
postgresql versions. Secondly, there is no easy way to get hold of
all the generated identifiers in such a multi-insert when using
AUTO\_INCREMENT or SERIAL and an ORM needs the identifiers for
identity management of the objects. Lastly, insert performance is
rarely the bottleneck of an ORM. Normal inserts are more than fast
enough for most situations and if you really want to do fast bulk
inserts, then a multi-insert is not the best way anyway, i.e.
Postgres COPY or Mysql LOAD DATA INFILE are several orders of
magnitude faster.</p>
<p>These are the reasons why it is not worth the effort to implement
an abstraction that performs multi-inserts on mysql and postgresql
in an ORM.</p>
<p>I hope that clears up some questionmarks.</p>
