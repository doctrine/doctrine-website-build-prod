            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To simplify our own administrative burden, we have decided to move over the
funds to <a href="https://opencollective.com/doctrine">OpenCollective</a>, primarily
motivated by the success and positive experience of the new PHP Foundation.</p>
<p>We have started raising money for the Doctrine Project in 2019 through Patreon and
Github Sponsors to support the project. It was planned to organize core team
get-togethers/hackathons, but due to the pandemic we haven't been able to do this.
In addition the legal and tax implications of raising money also caused us
some headaches. </p>
<p>The move to OpenCollective will allow us to delegate much of the administrative
work to them for a small percentage of the raised capital. The fee is a much
smaller amount than the taxes that we had to pay on the raised money
previously, so it is a win-win for us.</p>
<p>We want to assure our sponsors that we still plan to make use of the funds
to further the Doctrine project and we are actively looking to increase our funding
for these goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regularly organize hackathons for Doctrine Core team contributors, including
3-4 days of accommodation, food and travel for roughly 10-15 people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infrastructure, servers and hosting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marketing material such as stickers, t-shirts and other small things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the budget increases significantly we might be able to pay someone part-
or full-time to do maintenance work such as responding to and processing
issues, prepare for new PHP releases and general cleanups of the codebase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As such we hope to convince you to sponsor Doctrine through either our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/doctrine/">Github
Sponsors</a> or
<a href="https://opencollective.com/doctrine">OpenCollective</a> directly.</p>]]></content>

            <id>https://www.doctrine-project.org/2022/01/22/sunsetting-dbal-2.html</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since the release of <a href="https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/releases/tag/3.0.0">Doctrine DBAL 3.0.0 </a> in November 2020,
the 2.x release series effectively went into the maintenance mode. In the past year, we've been accepting mostly
the following types of patches for DBAL 2:</p>
<ol>
<li>Development dependency updates</li>
<li>Security fixes</li>
<li>Improvements to compatibility with PHP 8.1</li>
<li>Improvements in the upgrade path to DBAL 3</li>
</ol>
<p>Except for dependency updates, at the moment, there are no known issues in DBAL 2 that would fall into any of
the above categories.</p>
<p>Many projects that depend on Doctrine DBAL depend on it indirectly via Doctrine ORM which until
<a href="https://github.com/doctrine/orm/releases/tag/2.10.0">release 2.10.0</a> didn't support DBAL 3.
It was one of the blockers of the DBAL 3 adoption which is no longer the case.</p>
<p>With all that said, the DBAL team announces the plan for sunsetting DBAL 2 in 6 months as of the ORM 2.10.0 release
which is April 3, 2022. After that date, we plan to release DBAL 2 only to address security related
and other critical issues for at most a year.</p>
<p>All Doctrine DBAL users are encourarged to upgrade to the latest stable version
which is <a href="https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/releases/tag/3.3.0">3.3.0</a> as of the time of this writing.</p>
<p>For migrating from DBAL 2 to 3, see our two blog posts on DBAL 2.13 Forward Compatibility Layer:</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have released a new minor version 2.11 of Doctrine ORM with several improvements
and new features.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/doctrine/orm/releases/tag/2.11.0">See all changes and contributors in the
Changelog</a> on Github.</p>
<p>This blog post gives an overview over all the new features and improvements
that are user facing. Please see the changelog and UPGRADE notes for new
deprecations.</p>
<h2>PHP 8.1 Enum Support</h2>
<p>With PHP 8.1 the language has first class support for enumerations and Doctrine
ORM 2.11 supports the mapping of database values to <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.enumerations.backed.php">Backed
Enums</a>.</p>
<p>The support is not integrated on DBAL Type level, but using a new mapping option
called <code>enumType</code> on column/field declaration level:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">enum Suit: string {
    case Hearts = 'H';
    case Diamonds = 'D';
    case Clubs = 'C';
    case Spades = 'S';
}

#[Entity]
class Card
{
    /** ... */

    #[Column(type: 'string', enumType: Suit::class)]
    public $suit;
}</code></pre>
<h2>Virtual and Generated Columns</h2>
<p>There has been constant demand for this feature for a long time, to add support
for columns that are not insertable/updatable and might have their value
updated on the database side.</p>
<p>We have worked along the lines of Java Persistence API support of <code>insertable</code>,
<code>updatable</code> and <code>generated</code> options for field mappings.</p>
<p>There are two major use cases for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Map a column several times, for example with join columns:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-php">#[Entity]
class User
{
     #[ManyToOne(targetEntity: Country:class), JoinColumn(name: "country_code", referencedColumnName: "country_code")]
     public $country;

     #[Column(type: "string", name: "country_code", insertable: false, updatable: false)]
     public $countryCode;
}</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Columns updated by the database</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-php">#[Entity]
class Article
{
    #[Column(type: "datetime",
        columnDefinition: "TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP",
        insertable: false,
        updatable: false,
        generated: "ALWAYS")]
    public $created;
}</code></pre>
<h2>Support for Readonly Properties</h2>
<p>Another PHP 8.1 feature is the new readonly keyword that prevents the value of
a property to be written again after it has been initialized in the constructor
of an object.</p>
<p>With ORM 2.11 the support now works as you would expect with no additional
mapping options necessary:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">#[Entity, Table(name: 'author')]
class Author
{
    #[Column, Id, GeneratedValue]
    private readonly int $id;

    #[Column]
    private readonly string $name;
}</code></pre>
<h2>AssociationOverrides and AttributeOverrides in Attribute Driver</h2>
<p>The new <code>AttributeDriver</code> for PHP 8 did not support the equivalent mapping
options for association and attribute overrides that are available for XML and
Annotation mapping, because in PHP 8.0 it was not possible to nest complex
attributes. </p>
<p>With the support now available in PHP 8.1 we have added these attributes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping\AssociationOverride;
use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping\AssociationOverrides;
use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping\AttributeOverride;
use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping\AttributeOverrides;
use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping\Column;
use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping\Entity;

#[AssociationOverrides([
    new AssociationOverride(
        name: "groups",
        joinTable: new JoinTable(
            name: "ddc964_users_admingroups",
        ),
        joinColumns: [new JoinColumn(name: "adminuser_id")],
        inverseJoinColumns: [new JoinColumn(name: "admingroup_id")]
    )
])]
#[AttributeOverrides([
    new AttributeOverride(
        name: "id",
        column: new Column(name: "guest_id", type: "integer", length: 140)
    )])]
class DDC964Admin extends DDC964User
{
}</code></pre>
<p>For PHP 8.0 we have already moved <code>Index</code> and <code>JoinColumn</code> mappings to the top
level to avoid nesting and decided not to allow nesting for these to mimic
annotation support.</p>
<h2>Allow arithmetic expressions within IN operator</h2>
<p>It is now possible to use arithmetic expressions or functions inside the IN operator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.id IN (1 + 1, FOO(u.id))</code></pre>
<h2>Ignore entity classes in schema tool</h2>
<p>You can now specify Entity FQCNs to ignore during schema tool creation and comparison.
<code>SchemaTool</code> will then skip these (e.g. when comparing schemas).</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
$config-&gt;setSchemaIgnoreClasses([$fqcn]);
$config-&gt;getSchemaIgnoreClasses();</code></pre>]]></content>

            <link href="https://www.doctrine-project.org/2021/12/04/mongodb-odm-2.3.html"/>
            <updated>2021-12-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
            <id>https://www.doctrine-project.org/2021/12/04/mongodb-odm-2.3.html</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have released a new minor version 2.3 of Doctrine MongoDB ODM, the first version
with support for using PHP 8 Attributes as a new driver for mapping documents
and several other changes. <a href="https://github.com/doctrine/mongodb-odm/releases/tag/2.3.0">See all changes and contributors in the
Changelog</a> on GitHub.</p>
<h2>Attributes Mapping Driver</h2>
<p>The following code example shows many of the mappings that are re-using
the annotation classes for familiarity:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">use Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\Mapping\Annotations as MongoDB;
use Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\Types\Type;

#[MongoDB\Document(repositoryClass: PostRepository::class)]
class Post
{
    #[MongoDB\Id]
    private string $id;

    #[MongoDB\Field(type: Type::BOOLEAN)]
    private bool $published = false;

    #[MongoDB\Field(type: Types::COLLECTION)]
    private array $text = [];

    #[MongoDB\ReferenceOne(targetDocument: User::class)]
    public $author;

    #[MongoDB\ReferenceMany(targetDocument: Tag::class)]
    public Collection $tags;
}</code></pre>
<p>You may want to use <a href="https://getrector.org/">Rector</a> with <code>DoctrineSetList::DOCTRINE_ODM_23</code> set
to convert all your annotation mappings to attributes in seconds!</p>
<h2>JSON Schema Validation</h2>
<p>MongoDB ≥ 3.6 offers the capability to validate documents during
insertions and updates through a JSON schema associated with the collection.
<a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/schema-validation/">See MongoDB documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Doctrine MongoDB ODM now provides a way to take advantage of this functionality thanks to the new
<a href="https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-mongodb-odm/en/latest/reference/annotations-reference.html#validation"><code>#[Validation]</code></a> mapping.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">use Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\Mapping\Annotations as MongoDB;
use Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\Mapping\ClassMetadata;

#[MongoDB\Document]
#[MongoDB\Validation(
    validator: SchemaValidated::VALIDATOR,
    action: ClassMetadata::SCHEMA_VALIDATION_ACTION_WARN
)]
class SchemaValidated
{
    public const VALIDATOR = &lt;&lt;&lt;'EOT'
{
    "$jsonSchema": {
        "required": ["name"],
        "properties": {
            "name": {
                "bsonType": "string",
                "description": "must be a string and is required"
            }
        }
    },
    "$or": [
        { "phone": { "$type": "string" } },
        { "email": { "$regex": { "$regularExpression" : { "pattern": "@mongodb\\.com$", "options": "" } } } },
        { "status": { "$in": [ "Unknown", "Incomplete" ] } }
    ]
}
EOT;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Once defined, those options will be added to the collection after running
the <code>odm:schema:create</code> or <code>odm:schema:update</code> command.</p>
<h2>Psalmified APIs</h2>
<p>In-code documentation has been immensely improved to make sure static analysis tools and IDEs know
about the right document classes returned from <code>DocumentManager</code>,
<code>ClassMetadata</code>, and other public APIs. This includes generics support
for your own repositories extending <code>DocumentRepository</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">use Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\Repository\DocumentRepository;
use App\Document\User;

/**
 * @template-extends DocumentRepository&lt;User&gt;
 */
class UserRepository extends DocumentRepository
{
}</code></pre>
<h2>Deprecations</h2>
<p>Doctrine MongoDB ODM 2.3 introduces several minor deprecations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\Proxy\Resolver\ClassNameResolver</code> interface has been deprecated in favor
of the <code>Doctrine\Persistence\Mapping\ProxyClassNameResolver</code> interface</li>
<li>Annotation classes no longer extend <code>Doctrine\Common\Annotations\Annotation</code> class</li>
<li>Annotation arguments switched to <code>@NamedArgumentConstructor</code> for Attribute compatibility</li>
<li><code>@Inheritance</code> annotation has been removed as it was never used</li>
<li>Document Namespace Aliases (<code>'MyBundle:User</code>) - use fully qualified class names instead (<code>User::class</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Read more in our <a href="https://github.com/doctrine/mongodb-odm/blob/2.3.x/UPGRADE-2.3.md">upgrading</a> document. </p>
<h2>Coding Standard Support</h2>
<p>Doctrine MongoDB ODM 2.3 now supports and fully validates against Doctrine Coding
Standard version 9.0+. This greatly improves automatic pull request checks as
all new violations in a PR get caught and inlined into the PR as comments.</p>]]></content>

            <title type="html"><![CDATA[New Release: Doctrine DBAL 3.2.0]]></title>
            <link href="https://www.doctrine-project.org/2021/11/26/dbal-3.2.0.html"/>
            <updated>2021-11-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
            <id>https://www.doctrine-project.org/2021/11/26/dbal-3.2.0.html</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine DBAL 3.2.0. As most of the minor releases, this one
focuses on new features, improvements and deprecations of the old APIs. Here are some details on the most significant
features and improvements:</p>
<h2>Platform-aware schema comparison (<a href="https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/pull/4746">#4746</a>)</h2>
<p>Up until this release, the logic of comparing database schemas had a major design flaw: it took into account only the
abstract schema definitions without taking the target platform into account.</p>
<p>This flaw would lead to multiple issues which shared the same root cause: the two definitions could be considered
different by the DBAL, but they would produce the same DDL.</p>
<p>For instance, consider the two column definitions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">// old schema
$column1 = new Column('contents', Type::getType('text'));

// new schema
$column2 = new Column('contents', Type::getType('text'), ['default' =&gt; 'Hello, world!']);</code></pre>
<p>If we compared them with the comparator, we'd get a diff:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">$comparator = new Comparator();
$comparator-&gt;diffColumn($column1, $column2);
// array(1) {
//   [0] =&gt;
//   string(7) "default"
// }</code></pre>
<p>This might be valid for the platforms that support the <code>DEFAULT</code>  constraint on <code>TEXT</code> columns but isn't valid for those
that don't support it (e.g. MySQL). Regardless of the diff, both definitions would produce the same DDL on MySQL:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">contents LONGTEXT NOT NULL</code></pre>
<p>An attempt to migrate the old schema to the new one would produce a false-positive diff but applying it wouldn't result
in any schema changes.</p>
<p>A false-negative diff was also possible. Consider these following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">// old schema
$column1 = new Column('settings', Type::getType('json'));

// new schema
$column2 = new Column('settings', Type::getType('json'), ['length' =&gt; 16777215]);</code></pre>
<p>Comparison of the above column definitions should have triggered a diff on MySQL and migrate the underlying column
from <code>TEXT</code> to <code>MEDIUMTEXT</code> but it didn't, because the DBAL would ignore the length of the <code>TEXT</code> columns.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the DBAL would compare only a subset of the definitions, so some column options as the character set
and collation weren't taken into account during comparison at all.</p>
<h3>The new approach</h3>
<p>Instead of comparing abstract definitions on a per-property basis, the new implementation compares the DDL that is generated from both definitions for the target database platform. If the definitions produce the same DDL, they are considered equal. According to the tests and the number of resolved issues, this approach should be more accurate and less error-prone.</p>
<p>Implementing this approach was impossible without introducing a new API which rendered the existing API obsolete.</p>
<p>Prior to DBAL <code>3.2.0</code>, the schema comparator could be only instantiated directly via the <code>new</code> keyword:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">$comparator = new Comparator();</code></pre>
<p>Instantiated like this, the comparator doesn't have a notion of the target database platform and cannot perform the comparison properly. That is why, this way of instantiation is deprecated in favor of instantiating the comparator by the schema manager:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">$schemaManager = $connection-&gt;createSchemaManager();
$comparator = $schemaManager-&gt;createComparator();</code></pre>
<p>This way, the schema manager can instantiate a platform-specific comparator and provide it with the necessary context (e.g. the default collation used by the database).</p>
<p>While the old API is still available, it is recommended to use the new API for more accurate comparison.</p>
<h2>Support for <code>psr/cache</code> (<a href="https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/pull/4620">#4620</a>)</h2>
<p>Since the Doctrine Cache library is being sunset, the new DBAL release introduced the ability to use a PSR-6 compatible implementation for result caching.</p>
<p>While both the <code>doctrine/cache</code> and <code>psr/cache</code> APIs will be supported until the next major DBAL release, we recommend users to switch to a PSR-6 compatible implementation in their projects.</p>
<h2>Support for <code>psr/log</code> (<a href="https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/pull/4967">#4967</a>)</h2>
<p>The <code>SQLLogger</code> interface was designed long ago and has certain limitations: there is no way to log messages at different logger levels and it is really challenging to extend the logger functionality without introducing breaking API changes.</p>
<p>The new DBAL release introduces a new middleware that can delegate logging to a PSR-3 compatible implementation.</p>
<p>Note that the new logger won't produce the messages identical to the ones produced by the old one. If you have any processes built around analysing log messages, you may need to make some changes before adopting the new API.</p>
<h2>Always cache the full result (<a href="https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/pull/5003">#5003</a>)</h2>
<p>The implementation of the result cache prior to DBAL 3.2.0 would store the result set in the cache only once it was fetched completely. It led to the following issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the result isn't yet cached and its consumer didn't fetch it completely, the query would be executed again.</li>
<li>In case of a cache miss, the DBAL would <code>get()</code> the cache entry twice: once to fetch the data and once to merge the just fetched result with other results that may be stored in the cache.</li>
</ol>
<p>The new implementation stores the results in the cache right after they were fetched. It simplifies the caching layer significantly and makes its behavior more straightforward.</p>
<h2>Add events for Transaction begin/commit/rollback (<a href="https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/pull/4622">#4622</a>)</h2>
<p>The new DBAL version introduces three more transaction-related events:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>onTransactionBegin</code>,</li>
<li><code>onTransactionCommit</code>,</li>
<li><code>onTransactionRollBack</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Subscribing to those might be helpful if the application logic integrates the database transaction flow with the business logic implemented outside the database. For instance, in the filesystem.</p>
<h2>Basic exception handling in IBM DB2 and SQL Server drivers (<a href="https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/pull/4929">#4929</a>, <a href="https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/pull/4928">#4928</a>)</h2>
<p>The DBAL provides a mechanism that converts driver-specific error codes to portable error-specific exceptions. For instance an attempt to insert <code>NULL</code> into a column that has a <code>NOT NULL</code> constraint applied will result in error with the code <code>1566</code> on MySQL and in <code>ORA-01400</code> on Oracle. The DBAL will convert these two errors to a portable <code>NotNullConstraintViolationException</code>.</p>
<p>Historically, the DBAL drivers based on the <code>ibm_db2</code>, <code>sqlsrv</code> and <code>pdo_sqlsrv</code> extensions did not support this feature and would thow a generic <code>DriverException</code>.</p>
<p>As of DBAL 3.2.0, this feature is supported by all bundled drivers.</p>
<h2>Improved <code>AbstractPlatform::getLengthExpression()</code> (<a href="https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/pull/4855">#4855</a>)</h2>
<p>Although the <code>LENGTH</code> expression was implemented for all supported database platforms, the different implementations didn't have consistent semantics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most implementations would return the length in characters (Unicode code points), which is the most expected behavior.</li>
<li>The implementations for MySQL and IBM DB2 would return the number of bytes. It worked fine for the strings that consisted only of the ANSI characters, but an attempt to use it with a wider range of characters would produce an unexpected result. For instance, the length of the string  <code>'Привет, мир!'</code> might be reported as <code>19</code> instead of <code>12</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>As of DBAL 3.2.0, all platforms return the length in Unicode points according to the character set used by the database connection. Note, SQL Server supports UTF-8 only as of SQL Server 2019.</p>

            <updated>2021-05-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
            <id>https://www.doctrine-project.org/2021/05/24/orm2.9.html</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have released a new minor version 2.9 of Doctrine ORM, the first version
with support for using PHP 8 Attributes as a new driver for mapping entities
and several other changes. <a href="https://github.com/doctrine/orm/releases/tag/2.9.0">See all changes and contributors in the
Changelog</a> on Github.</p>
<h2>Attributes Mapping Driver</h2>
<p>The following code example shows many of the mappings that are re-using
the annotation classes for familiarity:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">use Doctrine\DBAL\Types\Types;
use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping AS ORM;

#[ORM\Entity(repositoryClass: PostRepository::class)]
class Post
{
    #[ORM\Column(type: Types::INTEGER)]
    #[ORM\Id, ORM\GeneratedValue(strategy: 'AUTO')]
    private ?int $id;

    #[ORM\Column(type: Types::BOOLEAN)]
    private bool $published = false;

    #[ORM\Column(type: Types::SIMPLE_ARRAY)]
    private array $text = [];

    #[ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity: User::class)]
    public $author;

    #[ORM\ManyToMany(targetEntity: Tag::class)]
    #[ORM\JoinTable(name: "post_tags")]
    #[ORM\JoinColumn(name: "post_id", referencedColumnName: "id")]
    #[ORM\InverseJoinColumn(name: "tag_id", referencedColumnName: "id")]
    public Collection $tags;
}</code></pre>
<h2>Typed Property Defaults</h2>
<p>Since PHP 7.4 types can be declared on class properties and Doctrine now
uses these type declarations to reduce amount of mapping boilerplate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Columns don't need the type definitions</li>
<li>ManyToOne and OneToOne don't need target entity definitions</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping AS ORM;

#[ORM\Entity(repositoryClass: UserRepository::class)]
class User
{
    #[ORM\Id, ORM\Column, ORM\GeneratedValue]
    public ?int $id = null;

    #[ORM\Column]
    public \DateTime $created;

    #[ORM\ManyToOne]
    public Email $email;
}</code></pre>
<h2>Psalmified APIs</h2>
<p>Improved the documentation to make sure static analysis tools and IDEs know
about the right entity classes returned from <code>EntityManager</code>,
<code>EntityRepository</code> and other public ORM APIs. This includes generics support
when you extend <code>EntityRepository</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">use Doctrine\ORM\EntityRepository;
use App\Entity\User;

/**
 * @template-extends EntityRepository&lt;User&gt;
 */
class UserRepository extends EntityRepository
{
}</code></pre>
<h2>Query::HINT_READ_ONLY</h2>
<p>A new query hint is added that allows hydrating entities through DQL that are
marked as read only for the unit of work session, as long as they are not yet
loaded as writeable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">$dql = 'SELECT u FROM ' . ReadOnlyEntity::class . ' u WHERE u.id = ?1';

$query = $entityManager-&gt;createQuery($dql);
$query-&gt;setParameter(1, $user-&gt;id);
$query-&gt;setHint(Query::HINT_READ_ONLY, true);

$user = $query-&gt;getSingleResult();</code></pre>
<h2>Index/UniqueConstraints using Field Names</h2>
<p>Instead of specifying column names for an index or unique-constraint declaration
you can now alternatively use field names.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">
use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping AS ORM;

#[ORM\Entity]
#[ORM\Index(fields: ["isPublished"])]
class Post
{
    #[ORM\Column]
    public bool $isPublished = false;
}</code></pre>
<p>This simplifies mapping as the column names passed through the naming strategy
do not need to be known.</p>
<h2>INDEX BY Associations</h2>
<p>Previously DQL <code>INDEX BY</code> was not possible for assocations, now you can:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">$dql = 'SELECT p, u FROM Post INDEX BY p.author JOIN p.author u WHERE p.id = 3';</code></pre>
<h2>Deprecations</h2>
<p>Doctrine ORM 2.9 rethinks deprecations and integrates with our new
<a href="https://github.com/doctrine/deprecations/">doctrine/deprecations</a> library.</p>
<ul>
<li>Undeprecate <code>merge()</code> and <code>detach()</code> as no replacements are available yet</li>
<li>Notify Persist Change Tracking: Use Explicit Change Tracking instead</li>
<li>DQL <code>SELECT PARTIAL</code> syntax, use Value Objects with <code>SELECT NEW</code> instead</li>
<li><code>EntityManager::flush()</code> with arguments</li>
<li><code>EntityManager::clear()</code> with arguments (use detach)</li>
<li>Named Queries in Mapping (use Repository)</li>
<li><code>cli-config.php</code> for console command configuration, inject <code>EntityManagerProvider</code> instead.</li>
<li>Deprecate <code>doctrine/cache</code> for metadata caching, use PSR-6 cache instead</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cache Deprecations and PSR-6</h2>
<p>Over the next versions we will deprecate use of doctrine/cache and replace it
with PSR-6. If you are still using doctrine/cache code in your own application
make sure to force the versions to &quot;^1.10&quot; in composer.json.
<a href="https://github.com/doctrine/cache/issues/354">Details</a></p>
<h2>PHP 7.1 Support</h2>
<p>ORM 2.9 reintroduces PHP 7.1 support, because it wasn't technically unsupported
anyways.  No changes were necessary to the code to allow it again except in the
testsuite.</p>
<p>The PHP 7.1 support was re-added to allow a very broad approach to prepare for
some of the deprecations that are introduced in ORM 2 and will be removed in
version 3.0.</p>
<h2>Coding Standard Support</h2>
<p>Doctrine ORM 2.9 now supports and fully validates against Doctrine Coding
Standard version 9.0+. This greatly improves automatic pull request checks as
all new violations in a PR get caught and inlined into the PR as comments.</p>]]></content>

            <link href="https://www.doctrine-project.org/2021/04/19/dbal-2.13.1-3.1.0.html"/>
            <updated>2021-04-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
            <id>https://www.doctrine-project.org/2021/04/19/dbal-2.13.1-3.1.0.html</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last month <a href="https://www.doctrine-project.org/2021/03/29/dbal-2.13.html">we released DBAL
2.13.0</a> as an
important push for the ecosystem towards DBAL 3 with an extensive deprecation
and forward compatibility layer.</p>
<p>We made a few mistakes, given that the forward compatibility layer is quite complex.
As such we have now released Doctrine DBAL 2.13.1 and 3.1.0 with two new APIs
that improve the forward compatiblity.</p>
<p>The problem lies in <code>Statement::execute()</code>: 2.13.0 would return a <code>bool</code> and
3.0.0 would return a <code>Result</code> from this method. This kind of API change cannot
be handled with a forward compatibility.</p>
<p>As such we introduced two new APIs on <code>Statement</code> that replace <code>execute()</code>.
When the old code was:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">$statement = $connection-&gt;prepare('SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE col = ?');
$statement-&gt;execute();

$rows = $statement-&gt;fetchAll();</code></pre>
<p>Then the new code is now:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">$statement = $connection-&gt;prepare('SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE col = ?');
$result = $statement-&gt;executeQuery();

$rows = $result-&gt;fetchAllAssociative();</code></pre>
<p>The DBAL 2.13 forward compatiblity layer supports both versions of all code and
returns a Statement/Result hybrid that has all the APIs that the DBAL Statement
had up until version 2.12. This way you can move at your own pace from the old
to the new API in your code.</p>
<p>Thank you again to <a href="https://github.com/mdumoulin">mdumoulin</a> for the work on
improving the forward compatiblity and to <a href="https://twitter.com/srgmrzv">Sergei Morozov</a>
for the thorough reviews and comments.</p>
<p>Again I want to highlight the Runtime Deprecations library that we introduced
to support this migration. You can integrate this with your log stack during
development and testing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">use Doctrine\Deprecations\Deprecation;
use Monolog\Logger;
use Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler;

$log = new Logger('doctrine');
$log-&gt;pushHandler(new StreamHandler('deprecations.log', Logger::INFO));

Deprecation::enableWithPsrLogger($log);</code></pre>
<p>Or alternatively using PHP's global error handler:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">Deprecation::enableWithTriggerError();</code></pre>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.doctrine-project.org/2021/03/29/dbal-2.13.html">2.13 blog
post</a> for more
information about the migration to DBAL 3 and strategy recommendations.</p>]]></content>

            <link href="https://www.doctrine-project.org/2021/03/29/dbal-2.13.html"/>
            <updated>2021-03-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
            <id>https://www.doctrine-project.org/2021/03/29/dbal-2.13.html</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have released DBAL 2.13, what we plan to be the last minor version in the 2.x family of Doctrine DBAL.
This release includes additional forward compatibility to DBAL 3 around
<code>Statement</code> and <code>Result</code> API and with an integration in our new
deprecations logging library.</p>
<p>In addition this DBAL release re-enables PHP 7.1 and 7.2 compatibility to give
as much flexibility as possible to everyone with forward compatibility.</p>
<h3>Statement and Result Forward Compatibility</h3>
<p>DBAL 3.0 extracts all fetch-methods from the <code>Statement</code> API and moved them
to a new <code>Result</code> API that is returned from <code>Statement::execute</code>. We have
backported this API to 2.13 - so that you can support writing code for both
DBAL 2 and 3 at the same time.</p>
<p>Old code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">$statement = $connection-&gt;prepare('SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE col = ?');
$statement-&gt;bindParam(1, $value);
$statement-&gt;execute();

while (($row = $statement-&gt;fetch()) !== false) {
}

$connection-&gt;executeQuery('SELECT * FROM tbl')-&gt;fetchAll();</code></pre>
<p>New Code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">$statement = $connection-&gt;prepare('SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE col = ?');
$statement-&gt;bindParam(1, $value);
$result = $statement-&gt;executeQuery();

while (($row = $result-&gt;fetchAssociative()) !== false) {
}

$connection-&gt;executeStatement('SELECT * FROM tbl')-&gt;fetchAllAssociative();</code></pre>
<p>The Result Fetching API was improved to use more human-readable names:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">// Old
$stmt-&gt;fetch();
$stmt-&gt;fetch(PDO::FETCH_ARRAY);
$stmt-&gt;fetchColumn();
$stmt-&gt;fetchAll();

// New
$result = $stmt-&gt;execute();
$result-&gt;fetchAssociative();
$result-&gt;fetchNumeric();
$result-&gt;fetchOne();
$result-&gt;fetchAllAssociative();</code></pre>
<p>Many more changes have been made on the public API and also for the internals,
but these are the most common ones.</p>
<p>Thank you to <a href="https://github.com/mdumoulin">mdumoulin</a> for the work on
improving the forward compatiblity.</p>
<h3>Deprecations Logging</h3>
<p>We have wrestled internally for a long time with the strategy on runtime
deprecation going forward and settled on introducing a small, new API for
reporting the usage of deprecated APIs.</p>
<p>The reason for this abstraction is the potential for side effects caused by an
error handler and the potential overhead. We expect our deprecations to be
triggered a few hundred times in some requests as such the production overhead
must be minimal. </p>
<p>This means deprecation logging is disabled by default and you must enable
it to either use <code>@trigger_error</code> or a PSR-3 compatible logger.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/doctrine/deprecations/">deprecation library
README.md</a> for details on how to
configure and use it.</p>
<h3>PHP 7.1 and 7.2 Support</h3>
<p>A few large Doctrine DBAL deployments still support older versions of PHP that
are not officially supported anymore, but are covered by support of a few Linux
distributions.</p>
<p>To provide the largest possible flexibility to the ecosystem to run code with
both DBAL 2 or 3 this version of Doctrine DBAL will work again with PHP 7.1 and
7.2</p>
<h3>Migrate to DBAL 3</h3>
<p>We recommend a three step strategy to move your code-base and that of your
dependents to DBAL 3. It depends if you are working on a library or
platform that is dependent upon, or if you are working on a standalone application.</p>
<p>For a standalone application:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upgrade to DBAL 2.13 and enforce &quot;^2.13&quot; as a version constraint in
composer.json</li>
<li>Enable deprecation tracking and eliminate all deprecations triggered in your
codebase.</li>
<li>After fixing all deprecations, update composer constraint to &quot;^3.0&quot;.
Doctrine will upgrade to version 3 if all other dependencies you are using
are ready as well to upgrade to version 3. If it fails, you need to identify
and update the dependencies as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>For a library, framework or platform:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upgrade to DBAL 2.13 and enforce &quot;^2.13&quot; as a version constraint in
composer.json</li>
<li>Enable deprecation tracking and eliminate all deprecations triggered in your
codebase. Release a version so that all plugins and downstream users
can be notified of using deprecated Doctrine DBAL directly themselves.</li>
<li>After fixing all deprecations, update composer constraint to &quot;^2.13 | ^3.0&quot;.
Doctrine will only upgrade to version 3 if all other dependencies you are
using are ready as well to upgrade to version 3.</li>
</ol>
<p>We recommend the following strategies to detect the use of deprecated code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Psalm, other static analyzers or IDEs to detect the use of deprecated code.</li>
<li>If you have an extensive test-suite, register a PSR-3 logger with Doctrine
Deprecations to catch all deprecations while running the tests.</li>
<li>Otherwise register a PSR-3 logger with Doctrine Deprecations in development
or staging only and collect and fix them as well you can. This could be
done for a longer amount of time of days, weeks or months.</li>
<li>If that is not possible, register a PSR-3 logger in production. Make sure to
eliminate high frequency deprecations quickly or call <code>ignoreDeprecation</code> to
snooze them to avoid overhead.</li>
</ul>]]></content>

            <link href="https://www.doctrine-project.org/2020/11/17/dbal-3.0.0.html"/>
            <updated>2020-11-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
            <id>https://www.doctrine-project.org/2020/11/17/dbal-3.0.0.html</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have released a new major version of Doctrine DBAL, version 3.0.0. This new
major version comes almost 10 years after DBAL 2.0 was released on December
2010, then coupled into the ORM 2.0.</p>
<p>Today Doctrine DBAL is released independent of the ORM, thanks to Composer and
sees its new major version before the ORM.</p>
<p>This release was made possible foremost by
<a href="https://twitter.com/srgmrzv">Sergei Morozov</a>, our primary DBAL maintainer, who has
spent countless hours working on the package since 2016. Thank you!</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/releases/tag/3.0.0">Release Notes</a>
for a detailed list of changes.</p>
<p>This blog post covers a few of the major changes in a bit more detail to give
you an idea of what DBAL 3.0 looks like.</p>
<h3>Decouple DBAL from PDO</h3>
<p>The major theme of DBAL 3.0 is the decoupling from PDO. Instead of copying the
API verbatim like DBAL 2.0 did, DBAL 3.0 grows it into a better, more usable
direction.</p>
<p>We extract all fetch-methods from the <code>Statement</code> class and moved them to a new
<code>Result</code> class that is returned from <code>Statement::execute</code>.</p>
<p>Old code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">$statement = $connection-&gt;prepare('SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE col = ?');
$statement-&gt;bindParam(1, $value);
$statement-&gt;execute();

while ($row = $statement-&gt;fetch()) {
}</code></pre>
<p>New Code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">$statement = $connection-&gt;prepare('SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE col = ?');
$statement-&gt;bindParam(1, $value);
$result = $statement-&gt;execute();

while ($row = $result-&gt;fetchAssociative()) {
}</code></pre>
<p>The Result Fetching API was improved to use more human-readable names:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">// Old
$stmt-&gt;fetch();
$stmt-&gt;fetch(PDO::FETCH_ARRAY);
$stmt-&gt;fetchColumn();
$stmt-&gt;fetchAll();

// New
$stmt-&gt;fetchAssociative();
$stmt-&gt;fetchNumeric();
$stmt-&gt;fetchOne();
$stmt-&gt;fetchAllAssociative();</code></pre>
<p>Many more changes have been made on the public API and also for the internals,
but these are the most visible ones.</p>
<h3>Upgrading to DBAL 3 from 2</h3>
<p>DBAL 3 is a real new major release with significant changes to the public API. Depending
on your codebase a migration could require non-trivial work. However we do not intend
to leave you hanging with DBAL 2 and a future migration:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We intend to support DBAL 2.12 a while longer, including support for the
upcoming PHP 8.0, so that there is no rush for you to upgrade to DBAL 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DBAL 2.12 already includes forwards compatible API changes for all the new APIs,
so that you can migrate your code step by step to the new APIs already.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deprecated methods in DBAL 2.12 are tagged with the <code>@deprecated</code> doc-block
and static analysis tools such as Psalm, PHPStan and Phan can already help
you detect using or calling this deprecated code in your application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We intend to release another version of DBAL 2 which includes
optional triggering of deprecation messages at runtime similar to how Symfony
deals with deprecations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, with these approaches it will be possible for you to smoothly migrate
your application from DBAL 2 to 3.</p>
<p>As a note to libraries and frameworks that need to support multiple versions of
Doctrine DBAL: We recommend you start out with DBAL 2.12 and migrate all usages
of deprecated APIs to their newer counterparts. Then once you have managed
this, you can allow 3.0 and try to get your code working with both versions.
Unfortunately this may not be possible for all cases, because we could not
provide replacement APIs for everything and some features have been dropped
between DBAL 2 and 3.</p>
<h3>Outlook</h3>
<p>DBAL 3 is a huge first step towards a modern database abstraction layer,
independent from the legacy of PHP and PDO API design. In the future we plan to
improve DBAL in other ways that we haven't gotten around yet, such as more API
modernization, increased safety with use of strict scalar types in the code
base, better error handling and more.</p>]]></content>
